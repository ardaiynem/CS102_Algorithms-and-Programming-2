When I tried to combine code pieces even from my own group I have encountered that we separately wrote the same method without knowing

There were some syntax errors

There were multiple assignments of same variables

Some methods and variables required in Game class didn't have corresponding methods implementations and variables in Hangman class

Some data types of variable initialization in Game class didn't match with the returned data type of Hangman's methods

Our writing and indentation styles were differing from each other which leads to incoherent coding

There was a property missing which is knowSoFar, the required information was returned directly from a get method instead of returning the property

There is a remarkable lack of coherence in the code because of separate locations of methods' with similar function

There were some non-existing required methods in the main method of Game class. So, I had to implement those methods functions in main method

Some variables which have to be final weren't final while some of them were, which was also an incoherent situation

Some set methods were also required in order to manipulate some properties so that the requirements of the slide would be fulfilled

Many expectations werenâ€™t handled in my group members' codes

There were some extra methods which were not mentioned in the slide

There were some logical mistakes between related methods which were implemented by different group members

Method implementations weren't efficient enough since connection between the methods were weak

Generally, the codes were full of errors, they had a weak connection between each other since all implementations were developed with different strategies.
