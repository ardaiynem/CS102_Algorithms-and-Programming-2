At first it was easy to fill empty methods of basic classes of game objects such as Card, Cards and Player.

But then it got harder when it comes to relate these objects with each other by using some methods which should be implemented by us.

Having implemented all basic classes of the project, I struggled to figure out how to use them in MyCardGame class since it had many ToDo parts left to us.

Understanding the connection between non-implemented methods at different classes was a little bit hard at first glance.

At some parts I thought this project would be easier if I just started it from beginning instead of making connections between non implemented methods

As I understood what to do with which method through the game process, everything became clearer and more organized for me.

In this project I understood merging separate code parts which was implemented by someone else could be harder than implementing all of the project by myself.

Having done all parts of the project and main method, it was satisfying to see project runs without any error.
